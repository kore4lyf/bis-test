# BIS TEST

This test demonstrates integrating a **WordPress backend (as a headless CMS)** with a **Next.js frontend**, using **GraphQL**, **REST APIs**, and a **custom WordPress endpoint**.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Restore the WordPress Site

#### Requirements:

- [Local by Flywheel](https://localwp.com) installed

#### Steps:

1. Open **Local** - click `Import Site` - select `wp-headless-test-export.zip`
2. Start the site (name: `wp-headless-test`)
3. Visit: [http://wp-headless-test.local](http://wp-headless-test.local)
4. Admin Login:
   - **Username**: `root`
   - **Password**: `root` (or check your own setup)
5. Confirm the following plugins are **installed and activated**:
   - WPGraphQL
   - Easy Digital Downloads
6. In WordPress:
   - Navigate to `Appearance - Theme Editor - functions.php`
   - Confirm the custom REST API snippet for `submit-name` and `get-name` exists

---

### 2. Install & Run the Next.js App

#### Requirements:

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

#### Steps:

```bash
cd wp-next-test
cp .env.example .env.local
# Update environment variables below
npm install
npm run dev
````

---

## Environment Variables (`.env.local`)

```env
# Exchange rate API key (if using CurrencyLayer or another secured provider)
EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY=your_actual_key
```

> To get the API kindly visit [https://exchangerate.host/dashboard](https://exchangerate.host/dashboard). You must be a registered user to access your api key.

---

## Note on Exchange Rate API Endpoint

Originally, the task required fetching the NGN - USD exchange rate using this endpoint:

```

[https://api.exchangerate.host/latest?base=NGN\&symbols=USD](https://api.exchangerate.host/latest?base=NGN&symbols=USD)

````

However, when tested with an API key, it returned:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": 103,
    "type": "invalid_api_function"
  }
}
````

After checking the official API documentation, I realized that the `/latest` endpoint may no longer be available under the authenticated plan or was replaced for secured access.

### Solution

Based on some information in their documentation, I updated the project to use this with my api:

```
https://api.exchangerate.host/change?currencies=USD,NGN
```

This returned a valid result:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "change": true,
  "source": "USD",
  "quotes": {
    "USDNGN": {
      "start_rate": 1582.24939,
      "end_rate": 1583.010016,
      "change": 0.7606,
      "change_pct": 0.0481
    }
  }
}
```
